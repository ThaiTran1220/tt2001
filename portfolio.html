        <h3><a id="gamelink" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/258846154/#player" target="_blank">Try out the game!</a></h3>
        <h1>Description of the Game</h1>
        <h4>The purpose of the game is to eliminate as many monsters as you can <br>
        while trying to stay alive. Initially, there were supposed to be two <br>
        classes; however, we ran into some complications so the only class that<br>
        is currently available is the mage. The scoring system is based off of<br>
        how many monsters you've attacked and eliminated. The usage of random-<br>
        ness occurs in the script of the monster, in which their time to spawn is <br>
        random. The game gets difficult when the player reaches a total of 15 <br>
        points. At that moment, a message will appear, notifying the player that<br>
        the game will get harder; specifically, the monsters will appear more fast<br>
        and often. When the player reaches a total of 30 points, a message will appear,<br>
        notifying the player that they have won the game. Since the player has a total <br>
        of three lives, the game ends whenever the player gets hit by a monster three times.</h4>
        <h1>Reflection Piece</h1>
        <h4>The inspiration behind the game was behind my partner Clement's childhood<br>
        dream of always wanting to be a hero, hence the title "Hero Trial". Also<br>
        the majority of the design of the game was based off of a mobile game<br>
        "Will Hero". One successful point within the development of the game was <br>
        how we managed to create our own pixelated sprites. Another successful <br>
        point of the game was the movement of the sprite, which made it possible<br>
        to avoid the monsters. However, as we spent the majority of our time creating<br>
        the sprites and the aesthetic of the game, we were left with little time to<br>
        program our actual game and ended up only being able to complete the mage <br>
        route. Another obstable that occured was the movement of the character, which<br>
        was eventually resolved after at least two days and again, left us with <br>
        insufficient time to develop the actual game. If we had more time, we would<br>
        definitely complete the warrior route as well as making more stages and a <br>
        boss stage, which we have the sprite for but never got to implement it as<br>
        there were too many complications to handle last minute.</h4>
        <h1>Important Algorithm</h1>
        <img src="algorithm.PNG" alt="algorithm" style="width:25%">
        <h4>This is an essential algorithm to our game because without it, the user<br>
        wouldn't be able to move and it would be difficult to beat the game. It consists<br>
        of if-else commands that allow the player to move throughout the map freely.</h4>
